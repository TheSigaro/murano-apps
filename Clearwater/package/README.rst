Clearwater vIMS Murano Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clearwater is an open source implementation of IMS (the IP Multimedia
Subsystem) designed from the ground up for massively scalable deployment
in the Cloud to provide voice, video and messaging services to millions
of users. Clearwater combines the economics of over-the-top style service
platforms with the standards compliance expected of telco-grade communications
network solutions, and its Cloud-oriented design makes it extremely
well suited for deployment in a
Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) environment.
