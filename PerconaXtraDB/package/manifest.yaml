Name: Percona XtraDB Cluster
Description: |
   Percona XtraDB is an enhanced version of the InnoDB storage engine for MySQL
   and MariaDB. With more features, faster performance and better scalability
   on modern hardware, Percona XtraDB uses memory more efficiently, providing
   convenience and usability, particularly in high-load environments. It is
   backwards compatible with InnoDB, so you can use it as a drop-in replacement.
   Percona XtraDB also includes InnoDB's reliable ACID-compliant design and
   advanced MVCC architecture.
