BIND
====

BIND is open source software that implements the Domain Name System (DNS)
protocols for the Internet.
It is a reference implementation of those protocols,
but it is also production-grade software, suitable for use in high-volume
and high-reliability applications.
The name BIND stands for “Berkeley Internet Name Domain”,
because the software originated in the early 1980s
at the University of California at Berkeley.

BIND is by far the most widely used DNS software on the Internet,
providing a robust and stable platform on top of which organizations
can build distributed computing systems with the knowledge that those
systems are fully compliant with published DNS standards.
